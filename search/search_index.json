The tool has the potential to break Salesforce functionality when used, since we rely on monkey patching and internal APIs. We must ensure that you cannot break Salesforce just by having the tool installed or enabled. For example, we won't fix the setup search placeholder bug. * For manual ad-hoc tasks only. The tool is designed to help administrators and developers interact with Salesforce in the browser. It is after all a browser add-on. Enabling automation is a non-goal. * User experience is important. Features should be intuitive and discoverable, but efficiency is more important than discoverability. More advanced features should be hidden, and primary features should be central. Performance is key. * Automatically provide as much contextual information as possible, without overwhelming the user. Information that is presented automatically when needed is a lot more useful than information you need to explicitly request. For example, provide autocomplete for every input. * Provide easy access to the raw Salesforce API. Enhance the interaction in a way that does not break the core use case, if our enhancements fails. For example, ensure we can display the result of a data export even if we cannot parse the SOQL query. * It is fine to implement features that are already available in the core Salesforce UI, if we can make it easier, smarter or faster. * Ensure that it works for as many users as possible. (for system administrators, for standard users, with person accounts, with multi currency, with large data volumes, with professional edition, on a slow network etc.) * Be conservative about the number and complexity of Salesforce API requests we make, but don't sacrifice the other principles to do so. * Focus on system administrators, developers and integrators.</p>"},{"location":"#about","title":"About","text":"<p>By Thomas Prouvot and forked from S\u00f8ren Krabbe and Jesper Kristensen</p>"},{"location":"#license","title":"License","text":"<p>MIT</p>"},{"location":"release-note/","title":"Release Notes","text":""},{"location":"release-note/#version-116","title":"Version 1.16","text":"<ul> <li>Select \"Update\" action by default when the data paste in data-import page contains Id column feature 60 (by Bilel Morsli)</li> <li>Allow users to update API ## Version feature 58</li> <li>Add org instance in the popup and a link to Salesforce trust status website feature 53 (by Camille Guillory )</li> <li>Fix saved query when it contains \":\" issue 55 (by Victor Garcia )</li> </ul>"},{"location":"release-note/#version-115","title":"Version 1.15","text":"<ul> <li>Add \"PSet\" button to access user permission set assignment from User tab feature 49</li> <li>Add shortcut tab to access setup quick links feature 42</li> </ul>"},{"location":"release-note/#version-114","title":"Version 1.14","text":"<ul> <li>Add checkbox in flow builder to give the possibility to the user to scroll on the flow (by Samuel Krissi )</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Fix links (object fields and object list) for custom metadata objects issue 39</li> <li>Add shortcut link to object list from popup (idea by Samuel Krissi )</li> <li>Add shortcuts links to (list of record types, current SObject RecordType and objet details, show all data from user tab) from popup feature 34</li> <li>Update manifest ## Version from v2 to v3</li> <li>Auto detect SObject on import page when posting data which contain SObject header feature 30</li> <li>Update to Salesforce API v 57.0 (Spring '23)</li> <li>Switch background color on import page to alert users that it's a production environnement</li> <li>Implement Auth2 flow to generate access token for connected App</li> </ul>"},{"location":"release-note/#version-113","title":"Version 1.13","text":"<ul> <li>Automatically remove spaces from column name in import</li> <li>Update to Salesforce API v 56.0 (Winter '23)</li> <li>Add \"Skip all unknown fields\" to import page</li> <li>Add User Id to pop-up</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Support Enhanced Domain issue #222 from PR223</li> <li>Add inactive users to search result</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Update to Salesforce API v 55.0 (Summer '22)</li> <li>Update to Salesforce API v 54.0 (Spring '22)</li> <li>Sticked table header to the top on export</li> <li>Update to Salesforce API v 53.0 (Winter '22)</li> <li>Add label to saved query and sort list.</li> <li>Remove extra comma when autocomplete query in data export, or select a field from suggested fields just before 'FROM' keyword.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Add \"Copy Id\" option when clicking on a SObject field or Id in data export page.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Integrate UI updates from Garywoo's fork</li> </ul>"}]}
